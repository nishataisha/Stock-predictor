# Stock Price Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts stock prices using multiple models.

## Models Implemented

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural network)
- Random Forest
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)

## Project Structure

- `stockprice/` - Main project directory
  - `evaluation.py` - Code for evaluating model performance
  - `lstm.py` - LSTM model implementation
  - `randomForest.py` - Random Forest model implementation
  - `svr.py` - SVR model implementation

## Results

The models were evaluated on historical stock data. Results are stored in the `results/` directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
